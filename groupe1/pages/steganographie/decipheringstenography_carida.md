# Deciphering the Marauder's map

I found the formula after several tries. I first read the first line and then every other line, but it didn't work. Then I read the first word of each line, but that didn't work either.
So, I assumed that the "I" in the first line could be the beginning of the formula. I then looked for what word it might be associated with in the second line: "ne" or "jure". "I do" only worked until the second line. 

On the other hand, "I swear" could be associated with several other words in the third line, the most appropriate being "solemnly" .
That's when I noticed the shift: First line - first word, Second line - second word, Third line - third word, so on.

This gives us : 

| Line| Word     | 
| :--------------- |:---------------:| 
|First  |   Je / I      |
| Second | Jure / Solemnly              | 
| Third  | Solennellement / Swear        |   
| Fourth | Que / That | 
| Fifth | Mes / I |
| Sixth | Intentions / Am |
| Seventh | Sont / Up |
| Eighth  | Mauvaises / To |
| Ninth | No |
| Tenth | Good |

**Je jure que solennellement que mes intentions sont mauvais / I solemnly swear that I am up to no good !**
