Don't think you'll escape me anytime soon, allohomora !
Enough of your antics, silencio and join me my dear!
Come to me reparo before my heart suffers again from a Crac badaboum, you feel me ?
Crac badaboum me again, I promise to not disturb you.
A beginning of Tarrentallegra takes me so much I love you.
I am at a loss for words with all these emotions!
No matter where you are, I feel your hands petrifyingly tatalus me.
Come closer, sonorus let your voice be heard in every corner of the world!
So, magical your voice is,  Let’s find a place and Tarrentallegra all night !
Don’t put me in silencio my dear.
Please, marry me!
