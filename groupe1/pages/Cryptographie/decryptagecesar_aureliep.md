# Deciphering the Caesar code


To decipher this sentence with the Caesar code:

« Q LRAY GYYE OSPU LYRUI REH QI'G CQEY »

I had this alphabet:

AZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWXCVBN

I observed the cryptic sentence and spotted some typical English language signs that might point me in the right direction.

Firstly, I spotted the 'Q' by itself. A single letter word in English can only be "a" or "I".

Secondly, I spotted the "QI'G". Following the reasoning of my first observation, I deduced that it must be "I" for "IT'S".

I decided to do a test based on this assumption.

To get from the "Q" to the "I" one has to move 3 rows to the left.

So, I duplicated the given alphabet and placed it in parallel, 3 rows back, so that the "Q" corresponds with the "I". This gives:

A Z E R T Y U I O P Q S D F G H J K L M W X C V B N

V B N A Z E R T Y U I O P Q S D F G H J K L M W X C

I then deciphered the sentence by matching the top letters with the bottom letters: I for Q, H for L etc.

Finally, I got the message in plain English:

I HAVE SEEN YOUR HEART AND IT'S MINE

So my first assumption was correct. The key is: 3/left
