# Instructions

The Vigenère cipher (French pronunciation: ​[viʒnɛːʁ]) is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword.

Decryption is performed by going to the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position of the ciphertext letter in that row and then using the column's label as the plaintext.

Since we chose the subject of Harry Potter, and that we called our group "Magyar", I chose a line of the movie for the second code.

First, I needed a key, so I took the name "Voldemort".

Then, with the help of the table, I found the corresponding letter to encrypt it the sentences.





With the key: Voldemort

## First code : TCF DVQ HYX COWI FXCFW KFTQGQ.

Solution : You are the Half blood Prince.

## Second code : AWYG XTS TNK WQ BSG QRG, WIE EI HSIR RSLUC KCL VJIWG NGGK EJGP BSGFFIXGJPV EXCEZ OVP ZEK.

Solution : Find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
