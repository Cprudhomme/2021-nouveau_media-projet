Here is the two message to be deciphered according to the Vigenère method:

First message:

TCF  DVQ   HYX    COWI     FXCFW  KFTQGQ

Second message:

AWYG   XTS   TNK WQ BSG QRG, WIE   EI   HSIR   RSLUC KCL VJIWG    NGGK  EJGP BSGFFIXGJPV    EXCEZ  OVP ZEK.

In order to decrypt the following message, I had the following code at my disposal:

VOLDEMORT

All I had to do was to match the letters of the code to those of the message like this:

First message:


TCF  DVQ  HYX   COWI    FXCFW  KFTQGQ
VOL  DEM  ORT    VOLD     EMORT   VOLDEM

Second message:


AWYG   XTS   TNK WQ BSG QRG, WIE   EI   HSIR   RSLUC KCL VJIWG NGGK  EJGP 
VOLDE  MOR   TVO LD EMO RTV, OLD   EM   ORTV   OLDEM ORT VOLDE MORT VOLD

BSGFFIXGJPV    EXCEZ  OVP ZEK.
VOLDEMORTVO     LDEMO RTV OLD

Then, all I had to do was to understand that the letters on the x-axis are for the code.

Therefore, you had to look for the first letter of the code on the x-axis, and follow the ordinate line to get to the letter of the message and go up to find the corresponding letter.

So, here are the solutions:

First message:

You are the half blood Prince

Second message:

Find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
