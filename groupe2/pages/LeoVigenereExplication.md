# Explanations:

The encryption is done by writing the key at the top of the table, and then getting down to the key of the encrypted message.

e.g. Y on the first line, getting down to I gives us Q on the left.

To retrieve the text take the key, then go down to the letter of the message, and you'll find the meaning on the left.

e.g. For I go down to Q and find Y.

Repeat for the whole message.
