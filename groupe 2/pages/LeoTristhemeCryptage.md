# Mirror on the wall who is the prettiest Tom?: Steganography example like Trittheme

The greatest Tom, who should be named
Is not the one you love so dearly
who thinks of himself, and for no reason,
as the greatest Tom, silly snake
but it's rather, you should all agree,
the one who, and only one,
has been forgotten, more than once,
Stop. Press send.
