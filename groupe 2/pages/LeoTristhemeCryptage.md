# Mirror on the wall who is the prettiest Tom?: Steganography *a la* Johannes Trithemius

The greatest Tom, who **should** be named,
Is not the one you love so dearly,
Who thinks of himself, and for no reason,
As the greatest Tom, silly snake,
But, it's rather, you should all agree,
The one who, and only one,
Has been forgotten, more than once,
Stop. Press send.
