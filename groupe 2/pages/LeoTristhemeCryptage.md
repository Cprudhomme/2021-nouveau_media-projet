# Mirror on the wall who is the prettiest Tom?: Steganography *a la* Johannes Trithemius

The greatest Tom, who **should** be named,<br>
Is not the one you love so dearly,<br>
Who thinks of himself, and for no reason,<br>
As the greatest Tom, silly snake,<br>
But, it's rather, you should all agree,<br>
The one who, and only one,<br>
Has been forgotten, more than once,<br>
Stop. Press send.<br>
