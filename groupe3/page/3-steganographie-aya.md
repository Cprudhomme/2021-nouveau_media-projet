# A lovers' farewell : a steganography example that emulate George Sand's poem  

Come seek us where
We parted yesterday   
Our voices sound
Dull, our heart is in dismay. We Cannot sing, nor speak, can we?                             
Above the ground
Our woe shall break free
And while you are
Parting from us,                     
Searching, ponder this
Alas!
We've taken
Your youth, beauty, and fairness; That is what you'll sorely miss,
An hour
Have our hearts have long been intertwined                    
Long you'll have to look
For our long lost flame’s ignite
And to recover
From this heartache,                   
What we took
Shall ever after remain a burning ache,
But past an hour﻿,
May we go back  to the life,  before           
The prospect's black.
Farewell, my love,   
Too late, it's gone, it won't come back,
Nor shall our love.
