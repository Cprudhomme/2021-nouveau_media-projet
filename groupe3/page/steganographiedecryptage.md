Answers of Aya's steganography

Come seek us where
Our voices sound
We Cannot sing,
Above the ground
And while you are
Searching, ponder this
We've taken
what you'll sorely miss,
An hour,
Long you'll have to look
And to recover
What we took
But past an hourï»¿,
The prospect's black.
Too late, it's gone, it won't come back,
