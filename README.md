# 2021-nouveau_media-projet

This project is a Master degree project about cryptography and steganography.
It is achieved by Master 2 of the unit of formation and research "Languages, Arts and Music" in the University of Evry.
The goal of this project is to apply techniques of cryptography and steganography learned during the lecture "New Media".

## Project description

The theme of the project chosen by the students is Harry Potter. The students were divided into four groups with a specialized theme in relation to the general theme of the project.
You will find below the work done by each group.

- [Group 1](groupe1/pages/home.md)
- [Group 2](groupe 2/pages/Home.md)
- Group 3
- Group 4

## Instructions for project implementation

Examples of cryptography and steganography must be done in English and in markdown files.
Make 1 markdown file containing the example of cryptography/steganography, with a link to its explanation contained in another markdown file.

#### Tasks to be performed within a group:

- Tasks in cryptography:
  - Code Caesar with alphabet you create, so not the linear (random generation of letter order) and circular alphabet.
  - Code Vigenère with your own square that you create

- Tasks in Steganography:
  - Text hidden in a text, like Georges Sand and Alfred de Musset
  - Text hidden in a text, in the manner of Jean Tristhème by creating your own coded table according to your theme.
  - Image, text or sound hidden in an image (example of software that can be used: [Steganografree](https://www.logitheque.com/windows/steganografree-27908), two other examples of software are given in the steganography course)

For each cryptography and steganography technique:
1. Explain the technique used
2. Apply the technique to an example
3. Explain the technique to decrypt or recover the hidden data
4. Apply the technique on the encrypted/hidden example.
Two different students will have to do steps 1 + 2 and steps 3 + 4.

#### Tasks to be performed by a student:
Each student should have done at least one encryption/steganography example and one decryption/recovery example.
