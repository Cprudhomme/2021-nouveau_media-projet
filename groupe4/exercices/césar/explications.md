Caesar's cipher is the oldest method of cryptography commonly accepted by history. It consists of a mono-alphabetic substitution: each letter is replaced ("substitution") by a single other letter ("mono-alphabetic"), according to a certain shift in the alphabet or in an arbitrary way. Caesar used to use an offset of 3 letters: A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, etc. He therefore wrote his message normally, then replaced each letter with the one that corresponded to it.
Q = A
R = B
E = C
F  = D
W = E
K = F
U = G
G = H
N = I
D = J
J = K
C = L
V = M
Y = N
O = O
H = P
X = Q
T = R
S = S
Z = T
B = U
P = V
A = W
M = X
I = Y
L = Z
