Very nice ! Welcome to Poudlard, Mr Potter.
Our goal here is to teach you the Art of Magic.
Let me introduce you to your 2 new friends, Hermione and Ron.
Don't walk at night in Poudlard, it can be very scary for young wizards.
Emotionally, you will need to be strong, but don't ask me why.
Magic is such a unique art ! You have to use it wisely.
One last thing : stay in line with the others, don't try to discover all the secrets here.
Right now, you might don't understand, but then,
The silent will speak for itself.
